The goal of this project is to create a tool to make it easier to sort through arXiv
papers as they are released, i.e. Tinder for papers.

The prototoype is a simple, terminal-based tool that will present a paper's title,
authors, and abstract, and query for a simple positive/negative rating from the user,
then repeat for each paper released that day on arXiv. The ratings will be stored and
used to train an SVM to predict a paper's rating based on tf-idf of the abstract. Papers
for a given day will be presented in order of their predicted rating, which will
(hopefully) make it easier to only look at interesting papers instead of sorting through
250 papers a day to find 3 good ones. The experience of rating papers should be fast and
easy, akin to swiping left/right on Tinder.

Prototype roadmap:
    Get user rating for each paper
--> Fetch daily papers from arXiv
    Convert abstract to tf-idf representation, store representations and ratings
    Train SVM to predict ratings
    Sort papers by predicted rating

Features for later:
- Remove need to press Enter for each rating by getting input with Cython/curses
- Nicer printing with curses?
- Go through papers that you missed on previous days
- Add results to paper trail
- Android app?
- Multiple users?
