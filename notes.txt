The goal of this project is to create a tool to make it easier to sort through arXiv
papers as they are released, i.e. Tinder for papers.

The prototoype is a simple, terminal-based tool that will present a paper's title,
authors, and abstract, and query for a positive/negative rating from the user, then
repeat for each paper released that day on arXiv. The ratings will be stored and used to
train an SVM to predict a paper's rating based on tf-idf of the abstract. Papers for a
given day will be presented in order of their predicted rating, which will (hopefully)
make it easier to only look at interesting papers instead of sorting through 250 papers
a day to find 3 good ones. The experience of rating papers should be fast and easy, akin
to swiping left/right on Tinder.

Prototype roadmap:
    Get user rating for each paper
    Fetch daily papers from arXiv
    Train SVM to predict ratings
    Sort papers by predicted rating
    Refactor filtering by date

Features for later:
- Add results to paper trail
- Nicer printing with curses
- "Done" input to signal that the rest of the papers from batch are not worth searching
- Browse set of liked papers
- Caching query results
- Remove need to press Enter for each rating by getting input with Cython/curses
- Undo
- Bigram feature representation?
- Android app?
- Multiple users?
